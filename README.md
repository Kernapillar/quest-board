# QuestBoard

This project is a fullstack development refresher

The goal is to allow a user to login, view their quest board (list of quests) and click into each one for a description, required tasks, and reward for completion. The users should also be able to create personal quests for themselves  public quests to be available for everyone, and private quests that can be sent to specific users. 

Potential Ideas for extra funcitonality: 
- Incorporate chatGPT: Allow users the option of letting ChatGPT write the quest description for them. 
- allow for daily, weekly quests that become available at the start of each week/month 
- rotation of quests or random ones weekly/daily?
